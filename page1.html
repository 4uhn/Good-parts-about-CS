									Ann, aged 30, suffered a brainstem stroke that left her severely paralyzed. She lost all control over her body and was always short for breath.
									"Overnight, everything was taken from me." Ann wrote on a computer which allows her to type with small movements of her head. Today, Ann works closely
									with researchers at UC San Francisco and UC Berkeley to develop a system which allows for not only extremely accurate decoding of brain signals
									but alongisde, animating movements of that persons face during a conversation.
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									"Our goal is to restore a full, emobdied way of communicating, which is really the most natural way for us to talk with others"
									 <p class = "caption"> - EDWARD CHANG, MD, Chair Of Neurological Surgery at UCSF</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									This marks the first time that either speech of facial expressions will have been computed from brain signals. This system currently
									is able to "translate" about 80 words per minute which is a massive advancement compared to her current machine which "translates" 14 words 
									per minute.
								</p>

								<h3>Actual Tech behind it </h3>
								<p>
									When it comes to implementing this system, the team had to implant a paper-thin rectangle of 253 electrodes onto the surface of her brain over
									areas they had previously discovered which were critical for speech. These electrodes would then intercept the brain signals, that would have gone
									straight to her muscles if it wasn't for the stroke. A cable, plugged into a port fixed to Ann's head connects the electrodes to a bank of computers 
									as seen below.

							<p>
							  The team then proceeded to train the system's artificial intelligence to recognize her unique brain signals for speech. This involved repeating 
							  different phrases from a 1,024-word vocabulary dictionary until the computer specifically recognized Ann's brain activity patterns associated with 
							  the basics of speech. Rather than training the AI to recognize whole words, they ran the AI through smaller componenets known as phonemes which are 
							  sub-units of speech that form spoken words. "Hello", for example, contains four phoenemes : "HH", "AH", "L" and "OW"
							</p>

							<p>
                              With the approach with phonemes, the computer only needed to learn 39 phoenems to decipher any word in English. This sped up the training process by 
							  three fold and greatly improved the system's accuracy. "The accuracy, speed and vocabulary are crucial", said Sean Maetzger. who developed the text decoder
							  with Alex Silva. "It's what gives Ann the potential,in time, to communciate almost as fast as we do, and to have much more naturalistic and normal conversations"
							</p>

							<p>
								Ann's avatar was animated with the help of software that simulates and animates muslcle movements of the face, developed by Speech Graphic, a company that makes 
								AI-drive facial animation. The team then customized the machine-learning process which allowed the meshing of signals sent from Ann's brain as she was speaking 
								to the animated avatar made. 
							</p>

							<p>
								An important next step for this project is to create a wireless version of this system, allowing more free movement instead of being physically connected to the BCI.
								Currently, Ann continues to aid the develop the of technology which gives her "a sense of purpose and the feeling of contributing to society. It feels like I have a job again".
