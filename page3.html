								<h2>The Ukrainian e-governance breakthrough</h2>

								<p>
									The creation of Dia, a state-owned e-governance platform, is a major step towards the digitalization of Ukraine.
									It has kept the country running during wartime, as well as provided a myriad of other benefits for the people and
									government of Ukraine.
								</p>
								<p>
									It was officially launched on the 6th of Feb in 2020, as a work of 25 ukrainians who were set on transforming the
									country. Mykhailo Fedorov the deputy prime minister told how the app was approached:
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									like a “start up” but without the profit motive
									<p class="caption">- Mykhailo Fedorov, Minister of digital transformation</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									This resulted in ukrainians having access to 117 services, including things like management and use of all
									official government papers, payment of taxes and bills, and even the ability to register a business. Initially the
									app was made to help out during the covid pandemic but eventually ended up being a pillar of the ukrainian
									government, especially during the time of the Russian Invasion

								<h3>Importance</h3>
								<p>
									The first benefit of this app that comes to mind is the ability to access and use all of your official document
									online, in turn helping with decreasing beurocracy associated with public services, helping with corruption and
									cutting government costs along the way. Fewer people are needed to be employed in the public sector and fewer
									human interractions happen due to the access to all of the services. This also help with the efficiency, speed and
									transparency of all the services on offer.
								</p>
								<p>
									This app has also made a great impact on those who were had access to it in occupied teritories, as this was the only
									way in which these services could be accessed by these people. 
								</p>
								<h3> Challenges overcame </h3>
								<p>
									Diia is not just a wartime success story, of course. In the almost four years since it was first launched, 
									the app has managed to slowly but surely transform Ukrainian attitudes toward innovation while shaping perceptions 
									regarding the role of digital technologies in daily life. Following the introduction of digital passport and driver’s 
									license functions, Diia became a routine tool for millions of Ukrainians. The realities of the Russian invasion have 
									now further embedded the app into the country’s everyday existence.
								<p>
									This familiarity has helped build growing levels of public trust in the digital state. Indeed, most Ukrainians have
									overcome any initial fears related to the pace of digitalization in the country and now openly embrace Ukraine’s digital
									revolution. People are no longer paranoid about the possibility of personal data leakages and have stopped worrying about
									how elderly relatives will cope with smartphone technologies.
								</p>
								<p>
									It has also been some time since I last encountered by personal favorite: What will happen if the state has all my personal
									information? In reality, of course, the state has always had access to the information that is now digitally available via 
									Diia. The only difference is users can finally access this information themselves in a highly convenient and 
									transparent manner.
